# Project Codename Stair-Climbing-Robot 
### Software Requirements Specification
<br>


## 1) Introduction
### 1.1) Purpose
This software requirements specification document describes the functional
and nonfunctional requirements for software release 1.0 of project codename
"Stair-Climbing-Robot". This document is intended to be used by all project
contributors and should serve as the central definition of project 
requirements. Unless otherwise noted, all requirements specified are 
committed for release 1.0.

### 1.2) Document conventions
No special typographical conventions are used in this SRS.
<br>

### 1.3) Project scope
Project codename "Stair-Climbing-Robot" will encapsulate a Lego Mindstorms
EV3-based robotic system that will learn to climb up and down stairs through
trial and error. Software for this project will be responsible for 
controlling robot hardware and training it to interact with its surrounding
environment. For the full project roadmap, see [INSERT PROJECT ROADMAP
REFERENCE CITATION HERE].
